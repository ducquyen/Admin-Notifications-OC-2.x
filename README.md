 Opportunities:

     Flexible configuration of sending notifications for each administrator - for example, if you need to notify only one administrator about returns, check only the checkbox from him
     Ability to customize notifications for each order status
     Ability to set logging of query errors (it is recommended to install it only during the testing phase)
     Setting actions for a long message (cut or split into several).  Added due to limited character length in one message.
     Ability to set connection timeout (time in seconds to connect to servers).  Added to prevent a long "freeze" during checkout, registration, etc. in case of unavailability of messenger servers.
